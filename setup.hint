sdesc: "Organizes multiple virtual terminals in grids or tabs"
ldesc: "The goal of this project is to produce a useful tool for 
arranging terminals. It is inspired by programs such as 
gnome-multi-term, quadkonsole, etc. in that the main focus is arranging 
terminals in grids (tabs is the most common default method, which 
Terminator also supports)."
